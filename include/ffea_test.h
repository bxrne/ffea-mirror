// ffea_test allows you to build unit tests in FFEA that can be accessed via a
// .ffeatest script file The reason is that otherwise, you'd have to compile a
// new binary, and you can't easily separate out a small section of FFEA
// codebase to compile - you basically have to compile the whole binary each
// time.
